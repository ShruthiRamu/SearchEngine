    "body": "Current Planning Efforts       Point Reyes National Seashore is currently developing the management plans or working on the projects listed below. NEW! - Winter Habitat and Floodplain Enhancement Project Environmental Assessment In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the National Park Service (NPS) is reinitiating the public planning process for the preparation of an Environmental Assessment (EA) for the Winter Habitat and Floodplain Enhancement Project on Lagunitas Creek. The project is proposed by the Marin Municipal Water District (MMWD or the district) as part of the district's efforts to improve habitat for coho salmon and steelhead. The project was originally divided into two staggered phases, based on funding initially being only available for Phase I. The NPS conducted a month-long scoping period for the Phase I project that ended on January 11, 2016. However, more recently, the funding for implementation of Phase II has also been secured by the district. Therefore, scoping is being reinitiated and the EA will address the combined Phase I and II project. MMWD is funded for improvements at ten sites; eight of sites are on NPS lands requiring NPS approval through a public NEPA planning process. Public scoping is the first step to involve the public in the NEPA process. Its objective is to engage agencies, organizations, and the public early in the EA development process and to receive input on the proposed action, environmental issues that should be addressed in the EA, potential project alternatives, and sources of data that should be considered. The NPS encourages comments on the project and requests that the public identify topics and concerns and alternatives to the proposal that should be considered in the EA. The public comment period is open until August 3, 2016. You can read additional project information and a summary of comments submitted on the Phase I project earlier this year at the NPS Planning, Environment, and Public Comment website at http:\/\/parkplanning.nps.gov\/lagunitas. NOTE: If you previously submitted comments during the scoping period that ended in January 2016 for the Phase I project EA, those comments will be carried forward to this scoping process and considered in the development of the scope of this EA. A summary of the comments received during scoping for the Phase I project is included in the information posted to the project PEPC website noted above. More background information and supporting studies for the Winter Habitat and Floodplain Enhancement Project can be found on MMWD's Lagunitas Creek Watershed web page. Sir Francis Drake Boulevard Road Improvement EA\/IS The Environmental Assessment\/Initial Study (EA\/IS) with proposed Mitigated Negative Declaration for the Sir Francis Drake Boulevard Improvement Project was available for public review and comment from July 15, 2015 to August 13, 2015. The Federal Highway Administration Central Federal Lands Highway Division (CFLHD), in cooperation with Marin County and the National Park Service (NPS), has proposed improvements to Sir Francis Drake Boulevard within Point Reyes National Seashore. The project includes improvements to approximately 12 miles of Sir Francis Drake Boulevard from the intersection with Pierce Point Road to the intersection with Chimney Rock Road. The proposed improvements primarily consist of resurfacing, restoring, and rehabilitating Sir Francis Drake Boulevard in a manner that will closely follow the existing roadway. Funding for the project is currently programmed for 2018, but may be accelerated to 2016. Please note that a separate planning process for road improvements to Limantour Road, Chimney Rock Road, Lighthouse Road and other NPS maintained roadways and parking areas within Point Reyes National Seashore was concluded earlier in 2015 (see Road Maintenance and Improvement Projects at Point Reyes National Seashore below). The comment period for the Sir Francis Drake Boulevard Road Improvement EA\/IS ended Thursday, August 13, 2015. Interested parties were invited to submit comments through the project planning website at: http:\/\/parkplanning.nps.gov\/projectHome.cfm?projectID=53489. Accessibility Self-Evaluation and Transition Plan Point Reyes National Seashore sought public input on a plan designed to ensure that key park experiences are accessible to people of all abilities. All interested parties were invited to learn about the Accessibility Transition Plan and provide comments at an open house on Thursday, July 30, 2015, from 5:30 pm to 7 pm at the Bay Model Visitor Center, 2100 Bridgeway, Sausalito, California. Interested parties were also invited to submit comments through the project planning website at: http:\/\/parkplanning.nps.gov\/projectHome.cfm?projectID=59593. The 30-day public comment period ended Friday, August 14, 2015. Coastal Dune Habitat Restoration Project In 2012, the Seashore began to build upon an Environmental Assessment that was prepared for the Abbott's Lagoon Coastal Dune Restoration Project and expand the scope of its analysis to cover potential restoration efforts in other dune areas throughout the park. This Coastal Dune Restoration Environmental Assessment was released for public comment on Friday, January 9, 2015. The end of the comment period was Monday, February 9, 2015. On May 12, 2015, Point Reyes National Seashore issued a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) (530 KB PDF) for the Coastal Dune Restoration Environmental Assessment. Ranch Comprehensive Management Plan The National Park Service (NPS) has initiated a ranch planning process for the approximately 28,000 acres of working beef cattle and dairy ranches administered by Point Reyes National Seashore. The first step in the ranch planning process was initiation of public scoping. Scoping, which ran from April 21 through June 2, 2014, invited the public to comment so concerns were identified early and the analysis is focused on the issues raised. Point Reyes National Seashore hosted two community workshops for the Ranch Comprehensive Management Plan\/Environmental Assessment on November 20 and 21, 2014. The meetings provided an update on the Ranch Comprehensive Management Plan and solicited further thought and discussion from the public. For those who were unable to attend the meetings or who wished to submit additional comments, the NPS accepted written comments from November 17, 2014, to November 26, 2014. Road Maintenance and Improvement Projects at Point Reyes National Seashore The Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) for the Road Maintenance and Improvement Projects at Point Reyes National Seashore has been approved and is available at the NPS Planning, Environment and Public Comment (PEPC) website. The FONSI documents the decision-making process used by the NPS, in cooperation with the Federal Highway Administration, to select a strategy to rehabilitate 22 miles of paved park roads and parking areas based on the information and findings provided in the Environmental Assessment (EA) for the project. The NPS posted the Road Maintenance and Improvement Projects EA to the PEPC website and solicited comments on the EA from July 17, 2014, to August 18, 2014. In addition to documenting the NPS decision on the proposal, the FONSI includes the listing of mitigation measures to be followed during project implementation and responses to public comments received during the public review period. Roads which will be repaved and improved as part of this this project include Limantour Road and Chimney Rock and Lighthouse roads. Verizon Wireless Proposed Cellular Communications Facility, Point Reyes Hill The National Park Service is preparing an Environmental Assessment in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to evaluate an application from Verizon Wireless for a ten year right-of-way permit to install, operate, and maintain a commercial wireless telecommunication facility on Point Reyes Hill within the area zoned \"Radio Range Station.\" A 45-day public scoping period intended to engage the public in this NEPA process, which will evaluate the effects of the potential issuance of a right of way permit for the commercial telecommunications facility, closed on August 7, 2013.
