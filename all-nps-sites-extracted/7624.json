    "body": "Bear Paw Battlefield       Bear Paw Battlefield Located 15 miles south of Chinook, MT on Highway 240, the Bear Paw Battlefield commemorates the final battle of the Nez Perce War of 1877.  Following the breakout of war in Idaho, nearly 800 Nez Perce spent a long and arduous summer fleeing U.S. Army troops first toward Crow allies and then toward refuge in Canada. Forty miles short of the Canadian border and following a five-day battle and siege, the Nez Perce ceased fighting at Bear Paw on October 5th, 1877, in which Chief Joseph gave his immortal speech: \"From where the sun now stands, I will fight no more forever.\" Visiting the Battlefield The battlefield is open daily, year-round, during daylight hours.  The first stop should be the visitor center located at the Blaine County Museum, 501 Indiana Street in Chinook. The museum offers the audio\/visual presentation, \"40 Miles to Freedom,\" which depicts the battle and siege at Bear Paw. In the summer months, the museum is open from Memorial Day to Labor Day, Monday through Saturday 8:00 am to 5:00 pm (closed noon to 1 pm for lunch) and on Sunday from Noon to 5:00 pm.
