Preparing for the visit: Once your reservation is set, there are three important steps in planning any field trip to Sagamore Hill: 1. Teach at least one unit on Theodore Roosevelt prior to your visit to Sagamore Hill Adequate class preparation is essential to tie your curriculum with the material covered during your field trip to the Park. Students who have at least some background information on Theodore Roosevelt will have a much better experience at Sagamore Hill than those students who do not. For ideas, see the curriculum materials section of our website. 2. Bring your class here on schedule and prepared to spend 2 hours at the park Please arrive at least 10 minutes prior to your appointment and check in with a Park Ranger at the Visitor Center. Bus Parking: After unloading the students from the buses, please have the driver park in the designated bus parking spaces located in the third division of the lot. Also, please have the driver turn off the bus motor. (Idling is against the law!) Classes should be split into small groups numbering no more than 14 students. Students may visit the Old Orchard Museum to view exhibits, see one a short film on Theodore Roosevelt, and\/or complete one Junior Ranger program. Educational Program Resources We have structured our educational programs around curriculum-based Junior Ranger Activities that are interesting and enjoyable for the young visitor. Some are designed for class visits, while others are more appropriate for scouting groups; all are suitable for families with children ages eight and up. Junior Ranger Offerings: 1. Theodore Roosevelt and His Sagamore Hill Home - This activity is completed following a visit to the home of the 26th president. Children may do this when they visit with their families, or it is administered as a take-back-to-class activity for school groups who have visited as a follow up to the class visit. 2. The Theodore Roosevelt Museum History Hunt - Be a history detective and test your powers of observation. This activity is administered to young people and their families or during a site visit by school groups. For many children this will be their first Junior Ranger experience. 3.
