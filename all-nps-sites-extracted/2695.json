If you are planning a special event or activity, please contact the Chief Ranger for information regarding special use permits. Academic Fee Waivers Schools or other bona fide educational institutions (accredited, officially recognized, or tax exempt for educational purposes) may request an educational fee waiver. The fee waiver will allow qualifying groups free entry into the park for educational or scientific purposes.   Tuzigoot National Monument is grouped with Montezuma Castle National Monument (as well as Montezuma Well!). If you are planning on visiting Tuzigoot also, you need to fill out a separate fee waiver for that site.   To request an educational fee waiver, please use the following procedure:    Fax a Fee Waiver Form at least two weeks in advance of your planned visit. The rest of the request should be on school or educational institution letterhead and clearly state that you are requesting a fee waiver for educational purposes. For quicker response, include your fax number in the letter.  State the educational purpose of your visit, i.e., what your group will be studying during their park visit. And additional pages if necessary.  Include your itinerary! Indicate the date(s) and times you are planning to visit the park and include the number of students with the ages or grade levels and the number of adults that you will be bringing.   You may also review the Fee Waiver Form Directions. Please fax your request to Montezuma Castle at 928-567-6602. Questions? Contact Montezuma Castle by email or at 928-567-3322 x0.",
