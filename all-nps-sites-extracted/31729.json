    "body": "Lightning       Lightning is a common occurrence in the park, especially at higher elevations. It is important to be cautious during thunderstorms to ensure you and your family’s safety. Safety Tips: • If you can hear thunder, you are close enough to be struck by lightning. Lightning can strike up to 10 miles away from where it is raining.  • Be sure to check the weather report before planning any outdoor activities.  • At the first sound of thunder seek shelter immediately.  • Do not seek shelter under trees.  • If no shelter is available and you must remain outdoors be sure to avoid open fields, ridge lines, hill tops, isolated trees, and other tall objects.  • Avoid water and other wet areas.  • Avoid metal objects such as fences and poles. • Keep in mind that the tram at Pipestem Resort State Park will often shut down temporarily during lightning storms. Lightning First Aid: • Call 911  • If you are still within an active thunderstorm consider moving the victim to a safer location.  • Lightning victims do not carry an electrical charge. They are safe to touch and they need immediate medical attention.  • Deaths occurring due to lightning strikes typically result from cardiac arrest. Do not delay CPR if the victim is unresponsive or not breathing. Statistics:  • According to the National Weather Service, lightning causes an average of 62 deaths and 300 injuries in the United States every year.  • Lightning hits the earth an estimated 100 times per second on average, or 8.6 million times a day.  • It is estimated that the U.S. alone receives as many as 20 million cloud-to-ground lightning strikes per year from perhaps as many as 100,000 thunderstorms.",
