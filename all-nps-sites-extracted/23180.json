Consider using this sign when either very long or very short segments of original route will be signed. Use of either this sign or the Original Route BEGIN sign may be appropriate. Ask yourself: What's the best or most useful information for the public to be able to find and enjoy this segment of road? In many cases, either sign will work equally well.      Other Sign Web Pages: Auto Tour Route Local Tour Route Crossing To Original Route Original Route Original Route BEGIN Original Route END Historic Site Name Site Identification - Entrance",
