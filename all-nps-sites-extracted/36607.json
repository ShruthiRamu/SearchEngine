    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Basic Information     Special Use Permits     First Amendment Events                First Amendment Events      Freedom of speech, the press, religion, and assembly are rights, not privileges. However, the courts have recognized that activities associated with the exercise of these rights may be reasonably regulated to protect legitimate government interests. Therefore, in order to protect park resources, the NPS may regulate certain aspects of First Amendment activities, such as the time, the place and the manner in which they are conducted. It is the conduct associated with the exercise of these rights that is regulated, and never the content of the message.  A few guidelines:  There are no fees associated with First Amendment rights permits. No public assembly permits shall be issued for a period in excess of seven days. No sale or distribution of printed matter permits shall be issued for a period in excess of 14 consecutive days.  How to Apply Complete Form 10-930 [14k PDF File] and return it to the address on the form. Please allow at least two business days for processing.",
