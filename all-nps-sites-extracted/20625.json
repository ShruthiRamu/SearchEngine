    "body": "Fees & Reservations        Many of the state parks, museums, wildlife refuges, and other partner sites in the Chesapeake Bay region charge fees. Some take reservations for large groups visiting or for campground accommodations. For specific site information regarding fees and reservations, visit the website locations listed on the \"Directions\" page. Or, download \"Chesapeake Explorer\", the official NPS mobile app for the Chesapeake containing complete information for each partner site, including operating hours and fees where applicable.
