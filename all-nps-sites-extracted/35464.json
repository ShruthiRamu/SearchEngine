This can include commercial photography (film or still), guided tours and other business operations, scientific research, running and bicycle races on Highway 92, weddings, and large group picnics or other gatherings in the Swinging Bridge picnic area. Every situation is different, and doesn't need to be complicated or time consuming, but the permit process makes sure that park resources are protected and that the event doesn't unreasonably interfere with the enjoyment of the park by other visitors. See the links below for the most common permitting situations we encounter. For a Special Use Permit application, click here.
