They help raise public awareness of the historic trail location. Ideally, these signs are used where evidence of the trail is still visible, but they may also be used where the trail is no longer visible. These signs can be used on almost all speeds and classes of roads, although you probably won't want to use them on high speed and interstate highways.      Other Sign Web Pages: Auto Tour Route Local Tour Route To Original Route Original Route Original Route Next XX Miles Original Route BEGIN Original Route END Historic Site Name Site Identification - Entrance",
