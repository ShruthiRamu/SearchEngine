In many cases where the modern road deviates somewhat (is on and off of the historic trail alignment), each individual segment or minor deviation need not be identified and signed. As discussed in the description for use of the Original Route sign, proximity should be the guideline. If the historic trail proximity to the modern road can be easily perceived by the driver, it is not necessary to use this sign. If the modern road clearly deviates from the historic alignment and the historic route is no longer visible in any way, then placing a sign where the end of the historic original route ends may be appropriate and necessary.      Other Sign Web Pages:   Auto Tour Route Local Tour Route Crossing To Original Route Original Route Original Route Next XX Miles Original Route BEGIN Historic Site Name Site Identification - Entrance",
